Here is some digital art projects I've done. Most of my work consists of character art, either from original stories or fanart.



I've done multiple, mostly digital art projects, over the years. I've made characters as a part of a comic series which isn't out yet (and to be honest, should've been by now) but I always held myself back due to self-doubt, procrastination, and fear of what the world might think or not think at all. But in truth, it is a personal project that doesn't require acceptance or admittance from anyone else to exist. I could write a whole lot more on this, but that would be better for the blog pages. Without further ado, the first project -



**THE COMIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

This drawing kinda represents the state the comic is now: you can see the formation of something happening, but at the same time it looks like there is more to be done. I've been working on this story since 2020 and at times it feels like I'm a failure for not having at least the first chapters out now, but it's a big story and I'm a big procrastinator. I won't go too in depth about it here. Instead, enjoy some screencaps from it.

I actually started feeling proud of my art and the comic again looking for screenshots to represent the comic. At first, I was looking for the super-pristine, detailed art work I know exists within the pages, but wanted to show more of what the comic truly has to offer: characters and their situations/struggles. As of now, I have no idea when the comic will release, but there will be a time where I'll sit down in front of the computer, drawing tablet placed down and decide to consistently want it to happen because that's the only way it will.

**OTHER CHARACTER ART!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

As you can see, my skillset mainly lies in drawing people in my cartoonish style and I'm super proud of it. It's mine and sometimes it can be too easy to diminish how much I've drawn and my self worth when comparing to others. Not sure how that anecdote relates but here's other art I've done.



{{< figure src="/images/Characterart1.jpg" title="Art Competition Submission for a Game" width="900">}}



This was a character art submission for a game called "Dead by Daylight." Every year they host competitions for alternate designs for their original characters, this character's name is Sable Ward (not mine, belongs to Behavior Inc.). I didn't win the competition, but I am proud of the design I made, especially with the newspapers since it aligns with the character's interest in the occult and investigative qualities. The blurb on the left is just a custom story I wrote that runs parallel to the actual character's antics.



Looking back I am proud of a few aspects that I think represent the character quite well, like the boots/spiky clothing showing her goth aspect, and an inclusion of the game's antagonist (the Entity) on the back of her sweatshirt, and movie poster shirt (since her chapter had to do with film). I would have taken out the cat hat though, that was kind of a random addition.

*Editor's Note:*

*I do a lot of art on my phone, so I'll likely upload works from there in the future. Everything shown so far has been done with a drawing tablet on my computer.*
