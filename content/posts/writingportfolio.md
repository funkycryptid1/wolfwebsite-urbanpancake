Here are writings I'm proud of. I am a 2-time published author in one book of my own when I was 11 and a short story in an anthology of other students' work. Most of my stories are in the fantasy genre, since it is the one I am most interested in. Here's a collection of different writings spanning from a screenplay I'm writing to other various stories:



**THE CURRENT SCREENPLAY**

This is the start of the second scene of a screenplay I'm writing (a college horror flick). It's called Sorority Kills and it's about sorority girls that become friends, come together to fend off against evil, incel-ish fraternity members.



It's my first time attempting to adhere to the screenwriting format, which has been a fun journey on it's own, but like a lot of creative endeavors (including my comic), if it takes too long there is a chance that I'll burn out from doing it. The entire script is written, mostly in the acceptable format but still requires editing in regards to story events/efficiency.

**Kind of a summary of what I like to write and why...**



I like to read and write stories that appeal to emotions. Something that makes me feel good, bad, sorry for the characters, excited for them, at a loss for words while the music swells and sways me along its intended cinematic path. Maybe I'm thinking too close to movies with that line, but eh, I was a film major. I like it when things line up, feel just right, and music can do a lot of good. Seeing the pictures through the words, feeling the weight of how words are supposed to be delivered and pretending to be a part of that action is one of the great joys of being a deranged writer. But what I'm saying is real - stories that make you feel in any of the methods I listed above likely do so because they remind you of something even if you can't quite relate to the situation. You've probably never been in a love triangle, but you might have had your heart broken before. You might not have lost your family to the mob and gone on a revenge spree, but you probably know what it feels like to lose the people you love, so you can sympathize. Gosh, I need to finish this script.

*Editor's Note:*

*A lot of the writing I have is pretty sloppy and not fit for presentation. As I spend more time on the website and other projects, expect more content in the portfolios!*
