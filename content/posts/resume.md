*Editor's Note:*

*As you can see, I am at the start of my very cool employment journey. Having this website allows me to express myself a bit more than just a piece of paper headed to an office that will get skimmed by an AI and tossed in a bin. Please explore the rest of the website to get a good idea of who I am as a person; the goal is to make this website as readable, informative, and silly as possible.*
