There's something fascinating about low resolutions, anti-sleekness, and chunky buttons which draws me into a state of yearning. It might be the idea of freedom that every company seemed to have in the 00s that's extremely intriguing to me, the fact that they could show off their product how they saw fit, instead of a pristine, furnished archetype that exists in every modern website. Where's the fun? Why did it have to die for boring perfection? Among the very many eyesores that used to exist, clashing colors over clashing backgrounds, was freedom of expression that exists in very little doses today.



The goal of this blog is to do a deeper dive into something I kind of have an idea about, tell you what I've learned, and engage in a practice I haven't done much of since college: RESEARCH! I'd like to know what brought about the early stages of web page interfaces, how people expressed themselves on them, and what brought about the ones we know today.



With no word count minimum, or grammar police, I'm not quite sure how long or short this will be - since the only requirement of this blog is to meet my own satisfaction. So sit tight, enjoy the read, or don't, I don't know.



**I. The Old Web**
