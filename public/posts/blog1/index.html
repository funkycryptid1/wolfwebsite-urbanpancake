Good afternoon, this post is going to be written probably a few days before the website will actually go up. Nonetheless, this will be the first blog post on my website.
One of many things I can talk about is how I vaguely grew up in the time where the internet was largely unconquered and unrealized, meaning that no one knew how to take advantage of others yet through tactical marketing, algorithms, and overwhelming advertisements. I have hazy visions of what the internet used to be: artsy, loud, and honest with it&rsquo;s post-90s early 2000&rsquo;s aesthetics. Maybe those are more ideations of what once was and this website is kind of an attempt at having my own space in this world wide web. No one to tell me how it should be, just a place of my own that others can view.

<p>Good afternoon, this post is going to be written probably a few days before the website will actually go up. Nonetheless, this will be the first blog post on my website.</p>
<p>One of many things I can talk about is how I vaguely grew up in the time where the internet was largely unconquered and unrealized, meaning that no one knew how to take advantage of others yet through tactical marketing, algorithms, and overwhelming advertisements. I have hazy visions of what the internet used to be: artsy, loud, and honest with it&rsquo;s post-90s early 2000&rsquo;s aesthetics. Maybe those are more ideations of what once was and this website is kind of an attempt at having my own space in this world wide web. No one to tell me how it should be, just a place of my own that others can view.</p>
<p>Why did the old internet aesthetic go away for a shiny, marketable, simplified one? Fast, fast, fast is the way things are now, and it really shouldn&rsquo;t be if we really want to appreciate more things. Individualism is a dying art within webpages that are built like warehouses. I think I&rsquo;ll do more research on this for a future blog post, since it is something I find interesting: creativity and aesthetic of the old internet. For now, this is just a test, a pilot post if you will.</p>
<p>Future blog posts will range from researched topics I care about within the computer science/art space, short messages, and maybe stream of consciousness stuff, we&rsquo;ll see. This is a new, fun endeavor for me, so let&rsquo;s see how it plays out.</p>
